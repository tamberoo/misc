# because of the nature of this document, it's a poor reading experience on formats that can't display long lines without wrapping them (e.g, mobile phone screens, low resolution terminals, &c).
# this document is a TRACKLIST for the album "THE KEY IS ALWAYS LOVE ♡", listing its TRACKS in order, along with the samples used to make them.
#
# although there is a loose concept tying the album together, it's one that's based mostly on my own experiences, so you are free to conceptualise it based on yours.
# there are no hidden TRACKS on the album.
# all samples for each TRACK are listed in the order of appearance per TRACK, but for some TRACKS some samples technically appear at the same time.
# there are also "AS PERFORMED BY / ON" and "WRITTEN BY" sections for each of these samples, so as to give proper credit where necessary.
# if a sampled track contains a "~" inside the "WRITTEN BY" section, it means that the sampled song's songwriters were also credited as its "AS PERFORMED BY / ON" section. 
#
# all TRACKS on "THE KEY IS ALWAYS LOVE ♡" are credited as the following:
# arranged by:                 layla parker
# AS PERFORMED BY / ON:        MULTIPLE ARTISTS / (all artists listed in each sample)
# WRITTEN BY:                  MULTIPLE SONGWRITERS / (all songwriters listed in each sample)
